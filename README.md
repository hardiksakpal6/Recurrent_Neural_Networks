# Project: Recurrent Neural Networks

Welcome to Project: Recurrent Neural Networks! This project focuses on implementing basic RNN architectures for text generation, specifically Sequence-to-Sequence Models. These models take a sequence as input and generate another sequence as output.

## Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks particularly effective for processing sequential data. They are capable of capturing temporal dependencies within data, making them suitable for tasks like language modeling, translation, and text generation.

This project explores the implementation of Sequence-to-Sequence Models, which are a type of RNN architecture that maps input sequences to output sequences. It also touches upon Sequence-to-Vector Models, which produce a single output at the final time step, making them suitable for tasks like sequence classification.

## Features

- Implementation of basic RNN architectures
- Sequence-to-Sequence Models for text generation
- Sequence-to-Vector Models for sequence classification
- Easily adaptable for different datasets and tasks

## Usage
- Training: Use the provided scripts to train the RNN models on your dataset.
- Inference: Generate text or make predictions using the trained models.
- Customization: Adapt the models for different datasets or modify the architecture as needed.
